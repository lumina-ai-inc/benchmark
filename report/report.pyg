Given a question and a context, evaluate each sentence in the context for its relevance and criticality in answering the question.

For each sentence, respond with either '<critical>' or '<not_critical>'. A sentence is critical if it provides unique, indispensable information that directly contributes to answering the question.

Be extremely selective. If there's any doubt about the critical nature of the sentence, mark it as '<not_critical>'.

Respond in the following format:
1. <critical> or <not_critical>
2. <critical> or <not_critical>
3. <critical> or <not_critical>
...
